# [Proof of Concept] Control Fingerbot with Tuya BLE
  
1. Pair [Fingerbot](https://www.adaprox.io/products/fingerbot-plus-1) with Tuya Smart app on your phone (you don't need a Bluetooth hub).
2. Use [tuya-local-key-extractor](https://github.com/redphx/tuya-local-key-extractor) to extract required info.
3. Run `python finger_me.py` (requires Python 3).
